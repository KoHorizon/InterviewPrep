# InterviewLib

A collection of Go backend engineering challenges for technical interview preparation.

## About

This repository contains hands-on coding challenges designed to simulate real technical interview scenarios for mid-level backend engineers. Each challenge focuses on common patterns and problems encountered in Go backend development.

## Structure

Each challenge is organized in its own folder with the following structure:
```
challenge-XXX-name/
├── README.md          # Problem statement and requirements
├── main.go           # Solution implementation
└── solution.md       # Approach explanation and notes
```

## Challenges

| Challenge | Topic | Difficulty |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Coming soon... | | |

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/InterviewLib.git
cd InterviewLib
```

2. Navigate to a specific challenge
```bash
cd challenge-001-example
```

3. Read the problem statement in `README.md`

4. Implement your solution in `main.go`

5. Test your solution
```bash
go run main.go
```

## Focus Areas

These challenges cover key backend engineering concepts:

- **Concurrency & Goroutines** - Worker pools, channels, synchronization
- **System Design** - Rate limiting, caching, load balancing
- **Data Structures** - Custom implementations optimized for specific use cases
- **APIs & HTTP** - RESTful services, middleware, request handling
- **Database Integration** - Connection pooling, transactions, migrations
- **Performance** - Profiling, optimization, memory management
- **Testing** - Unit tests, integration tests, benchmarks

## Usage Tips

- Try to solve each challenge within a time limit (30-45 minutes)
- Focus on writing clean, production-ready code
- Consider edge cases and error handling
- Think about scalability and performance
- Write tests for your solutions
